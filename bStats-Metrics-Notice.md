# Players & Servers Graph
![bStats Graph: players & servers on LevelledMobs over time](https://bstats.org/signatures/bukkit/LevelledMobs.svg)

# Notice
We use bStats to gather very basic information about servers running LM, all of which is publicly visible [here](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/LevelledMobs/6269).

None of the information is sensitive in the slightest, as we value your privacy. **All** of it is publicly visible, and it is most likely that you would be completely fine at telling a random person the information you contribute to our bStats page. Java version, LM version, server country, Minecraft version, and so on.

No individual server can be siphoned for information as each server contributes to a single pool of data, among thousands of other servers. We're just interested in very broad, simple statistics, and bStats does exactly that for us.

We use these metrics to guide our development direction, as these usually help us make decisions without having to manually survey users.

# How to opt-out
If you wish to not send your metrics then you may edit the `/plugins/bStats/config.yml` file appropriately and restart your server.
