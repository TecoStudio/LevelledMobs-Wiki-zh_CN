## Maintainers

### PenalBuffalo *(aka stumper66)*

> ###### Development; User Support

PenalBuffalo has written the vast majority of LevelledMobs' code as the primary developer of LM3, keeping LevelledMobs afloat for the majority of its lifecycle and issuing all updates for the past 2 years. Penal has supported thousands of users on our Discord and has developed their fantastic ideas to improve the plugin.

### UltimaOath
> ###### User Support; Documentation; Testing
> A long-time user and contributor of LevelledMobs, contributing an invaluable amount of support to thousands of LevelledMobs users on Discord, sparked and flourished countless development ideas, written the majority of the Wiki, tested over 300 development builds, and far more. Oath's enormous contributions span across the entire project and are impossible to measure, providing a large driving force behind the premium quality the LevelledMobs presents to its users. The majority of the Rules System was designed by Oath, giving users a *ton* of power in customising the plugin in ways that most other plugins cannot match.

### lokka30
> ###### Development; Documentation
> Founder of LevelledMobs, taking major maintenance roles for LM1 and LM2, being the sole maintainer of the former. lokka30 worked alongside Oath in LM v2.6 to construct the deepest foundational logic that comprised the 'New Settings' system, where through Penal's development became the Rules System, a keystone of LM3's release. Aside from development on the upcoming LM4, lokka30 'keeps the lights on' by guiding the project's direction, and periodically provides support on the Discord and keeps Wiki information up-to-date.
